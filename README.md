Fake News Detection Model

This repository contains a machine-learning model that predicts fake news articles. The model uses the linear regression algorithm and has been trained on a pre-processed dataset to ensure accurate predictions.

Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from various news articles, both real and fake. It has been pre-processed using vectorization and stemming methods to enhance the accuracy of the model's predictions.

Model Training

The linear regression algorithm was chosen as it provides a good balance between simplicity and performance. The model was trained on the pre-processed dataset using labelled data where each article is classified as "real" or "fake". This supervised learning approach allows the model to learn patterns in the text data associated with different types of news.
